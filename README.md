## Project Prime
This is the first piece of code I've wrote to compute the prime number (way back, when Intel Pentium 4 was the fastest processor). This code was writen during my A-Levels time. There is nothing much in this script, except the ability to continue running (memory). Also it uses pointers which quicken the code.
